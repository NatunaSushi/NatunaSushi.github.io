#It is difficult to fully describe why I love Captain Gavin, so here is his fanfiction I made


One day, deadly Iy/n] was
walking to school when...
...a stranger in the street said "Could i have your autograph?"
"Please, sign my pebble " said the rather attractive female stranger "and my breasts please" deadly
[y/n] signed it, and handed it back "Here's my autograph!" said deadly [y/n]
"To be honest, while I did want your autograph...i also..you
see.....think your the sexiest person alive, and.." the stranger hesitated! I need yor help
urgently! You must save us!!" "what?howhu?"
"We need someone strong, and intelligent and mighty...you have been chosen!"
"But Im not that strong! Im just a weak nerdish school student!", deadly ly/n] said, flexing his muscles. "Well, I always felt there was something special about me...I
never thought i would be assigned a mission like this!", he lied. "You are the our last hope. Our
ancient carpetcommanded us to find you"
"You must save us from Dean Boyd we dont have the power on our Own"
"Very well,I suppose I'll help you" Suddenly, deadly Ly/n] was
sucked into a underground lab.
"This is where we have set up our high tech secret Há»Œ HeadQuaters!
"Theres someone that wants me meet you..."
At that movement a door slid open with a funny sound...light shined from behind and a shadow stode there
"So..this is the one we are after?" "He certainly looks as hansome as we heard" "And sexy too!" "And with nice big equipment too,
judging by the huge round lumps in the clothing"
Capitan Gavin walked out of the light!
"Welcome"
deadly y/n] was amazed!,
always brilliantly modest, deadly [y/n] never dream of recieveing such a compliemnent fromn
incredible Capitan Gavin.
"Thank you, its an honour to meet you"
"The honour is all mine"
"It was clear there was an instant, animal attraction between them...allthough both didnt want to admit it. "holyshit your sexy". "No time for that now!" said gavina. "We have work to do!"
They stoped kissing eachovers neck and looked like a torando of love hit them
In the darkness of that night, away from the preying eyes and ears of those who would judge, some
strangers slipped by unnoticed. But they were not strangers, they knew each-other. And they knew each-other much closer then any of their friends did realize. They knew each-other both inside and out. But their friends did not know this. Their friends could not know. Their friends should not know this.
Nor could they know. Because it
was night, and thus away from their viscous, judging eyeballs. "Is it safe?" said the first stranger, who was not a stranger to the
other stranger but will remain a stranger to us for the moment.
"I think so. Its dark so none of the others should see us here, even if they are nearby.I think our secret is safe."
"Good. I couldn't take their
judgement right now. My life is too stressful as it is. If it wasn't for you I don't know what Id do - other then kill myself of course."
"Don't worry Capitan Gavin, I will
always be here for you - waiting in the dark"
"Thanks, ly/n]. I will always be in the dark for you too"
With that the two shadows
embraced - an embracement in the night full of kissing and nighttime joys.
I was introduced at the others at the base. There was of course
beautiful gavina and snarkly
deadly ly/n]. Smart and clever
ryuji ryuji and... and obama.
I too had heard of obama and had always been a little insecure about my feelings for him and I'm still not sure if I'm really gay
But here he stood before me,
stretching and gesturing at
drawings on the wall. It looked so manly, so envigorating and virilus. And when he spoke, he sounded
so... I swooned right in front of him.
"We should defeat Dean Boyd,"
obama said.
"I agree," said Capitan Gavin, "but I'm not sure."
"We can use your new friend,"
said obama. "Dean Boyd doesn't
know deadly [y/n]. So that should do. We can infiltrate the base like that.
"But deadly [y/n] is still very inexperienced," said Capitan
Gavin, "And I worry about him."
"Don't worry" said obama, "I know deadly ly/n] can take it on. Trust me on that" And he gave me a wink.
In the corners of my eyes I saw Capitan Gavin stairing first at me, and then at him. And then in a huff, he walked away.
I walked after Capitan Gavin and said: "What's wrong?"
"Nutting" Capitan Gavin said but I didn't believe him.
"No seriously, you can tell me, I'm really go0d at picking up on these things."
"You're right, you're really good at picking up on those things," said
Capitan Gavin and sighed. He then said: "You know my past, right?"
I thought to myself, yes, yes I do. I heard of everything about you. And said: "yes"
"Well, it. it... makes it hard for me to make connections with people."
Capitan Gavin said. A single tear rolled down his cheek. It made it look even more pretty than it already was.
"And I feared,' Capitan Gavin said, "that when I saw you talk and awke at obama like that, that you may... you may no longer find me that interesting?"
"But I do!"
'And without you, I don't know if the world is still worth saving,"
Capitan Gavin said with a sniffle, "how can I defeat Dean Boyd if you won't be with me?"
"Well, uh, I didn't think you'd like me that much," I said blushing manly.
But then, then Capitan Gavin
leaned forward and kissed me.
And I no longer knew what to do. Can I be in love with both? Why must I choose?
For a moment time seemned to slowed down. Capitan Gavin
wondered why. Capitan Gavin
turned around slowly (due to the time seeming to have slowed down).
Then the explanation - [y/n] was secretly looking at him. Looking at him in that special way.
Capitan Gavins soul lit up like a beacon in the night - even though it was day.
In all of this. In all of this mess. They had eachother, even if
eachother was the only ones that [y/n] turned away at that moment - Time jumped back to normal as Capitan Gavin was no longer transfixiated by [y/n].
Fortunately no one else had noticed.
Some time later in their secret hide-away;
"I am glade we found a way to survive all that and still be together"
"Yes, our plan seems to have worked despite all the events"
"Do you think anyone spotted us?"
"No"
"No"
"Yes"
Obama emerged from the
shadows of the darkness.
"I know everything" he said.
Capitan Gavin and [y/n] gasped. Their secret was finally revealed! "I dont love [y/n] like you do" said obama "but I have always lusted a bit after them. So you see if ly/n]
spends the night with me I will never tell anyone."
Capitan Gavin breathed a sigh of relief. That was, after all, a reasonable request. They agreed to the bargain.
"Phwee...thats something we can go along with" said [y/n] relieved.
Obama was happy, and Capitan Gavin and [y/n] thus got to live happily ever after together. With no one but obama and themselves ever knowing.
They saw their enemy in the distance, and they soon stood next to him

"So you have come"

"My sister is the most amazing girl in the city." said deadly [y/n].

"Dunno, but she is smaller than some alarmclocks." replied Dean Boyd.

"You know, I think my aunty would be better usefuller dont you think?" said deadly [y/n].

"Yes, but she is gayer than some carpets." declared Dean Boyd. "Your brother is the most amazing

wizzard in the city." said ryuji ryuji.

"No, but he is colder than some balloons." screamed Dean Boyd.

"You know what I would like? A dry banana." said deadly [y/n]. With him distracted with that our hero stabbed him so dean boyd fucking dies.
